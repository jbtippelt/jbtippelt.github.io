<i>Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.</i>

Well. This is the standart launch post text you see when you just follow the instruction of Jekyll. But it's true. Easys setup, easy use and the main point for me: all static.

What will I find on this site you may ask. The answer right now is: I don't know. For me it was firstly the challange to setup a cheap and lightweight website. For that a static site is the best choice you can make. No technical conditions, no database and realy fast. Of course you need some html skills and should know what ftp is, but there are so many tutorials that it's an easy thing to learn. I first thought about hosting the site on Amazon S3, but then I found out that Github is based on Amazon S3. And because I already had an Github account I tried it and it works fine. Until now^^.
During the setup of this site I maybe found another use of it. I'm currently studying Sofware Engineering at the University of Stuttgart and also work on some private projects like my first app [WorkTimeTracker (chek it out!)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.jak0bt.worktimetracker). Maybe there are some interesting topics to write about. The future will tell.

I think thats it for now. Hopefully there will be some more content here soon.
Have a nice day!
